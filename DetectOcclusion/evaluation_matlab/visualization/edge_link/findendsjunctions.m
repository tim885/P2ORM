% FINDENDSJUNCTIONS - find junctions and endings in a line/edge image
%
% Usage: [rj, cj, re, ce] = findendsjunctions(edgeim, disp)
% 
% Arguments:  edgeim - A binary image marking lines/edges in an image.  It is
%                      assumed that this is a thinned or skeleton image 
%             disp   - An optional flag 0/1 to indicate whether the edge
%                      image should be plotted with the junctions and endings
%                      marked.  This defaults to 0.
%
% Returns:    rj, cj - Row and column coordinates of junction points in the
%                      image. 
%             re, ce - Row and column coordinates of end points in the
%                      image.

%
% Note I am not sure if using bwmorph's 'thin' or 'skel' is best for finding
% junctions.  Skel can result in an image where multiple adjacent junctions are
% produced (maybe this is more a problem with this junction detection code).
% Thin, on the other hand, can produce different output when you rotate an image
% by 90 degrees.  On balance I think using 'thin' is better. Skeletonisation and
% thinning is surprisingly awkward.
