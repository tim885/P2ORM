% EDGELINK - Link edge points in an image into lists
%
% Usage: [edgelist edgeim, etype] = edgelink(im, minlength, location)
%
%    **Warning** 'minlength' is ignored at the moment because 'cleanedgelist'
%                 has some bugs and can be memory hungry
%
% Arguments:  im         - Binary edge image, it is assumed that edges
%                          have been thinned (or are nearly thin).
%             minlength  - Optional minimum edge length of interest, defaults
%                          to 1 if omitted or specified as []. Ignored at the
%                          moment. 
%             location   - Optional complex valued image holding subpixel
%                          locations of edge points. For any pixel the
%                          real part holds the subpixel row coordinate of
%                          that edge point and the imaginary part holds
%                          the column coordinate.  See NONMAXSUP.  If
%                          this argument is supplied the edgelists will
%                          be formed from the subpixel coordinates,
%                          otherwise the the integer pixel coordinates of
%                          points in 'im' are used.
%
% Returns:  edgelist - a cell array of edge lists in row,column coords in
%                      the form
%                     { [r1 c1   [r1 c1   etc }
%                        r2 c2    ...
%                        ...
%                        rN cN]   ....]   
%
%           edgeim   - Image with pixels labeled with edge number. 
%                      Note that junctions in the labeled edge image will be
%                      labeled with the edge number of the last edge that was
%                      tracked through it.  Note that this image also includes
%                      edges that do not meet the minimum length specification.
%                      If you want to see just the edges that meet the
%                      specification you should pass the edgelist to
%                      DRAWEDGELIST.
%
%            etype   - Array of values, one for each edge segment indicating
%                      its type
%                      0  - Start free, end free
%                      1  - Start free, end junction
%                      2  - Start junction, end free (should not happen)
%                      3  - Start junction, end junction
%                      4  - Loop
%
% This function links edge points together into lists of coordinate pairs.
% Where an edge junction is encountered the list is terminated and a separate
% list is generated for each of the branches.
%
% Note I am not sure if using bwmorph's 'thin' or 'skel' is best for
% preprocessing the edge image prior to edgelinking.  The main issue is the
% treatment of junctions.  Skel can result in an image where multiple adjacent
% junctions are produced (maybe this is more a problem with my junction
% detection code).  Thin, on the other hand, can produce different output when
% you rotate an image by 90 degrees. On balance I think using 'thin' is better.
% Note, however, the input image should be 'nearly thin' otherwise the thinning
% operation could shorten the ends of structures. Skeletonisation and thinning
% is surprisingly awkward.

% February  2001 - Original version
% September 2004 - Revised to allow subpixel edge data to be used
% November  2006 - Changed so that edgelists start and stop at every junction 
% January   2007 - Trackedge modified to discard isolated pixels and the
%                  problems they cause (thanks to Jeff Copeland)
% January   2007 - Fixed so that closed loops are closed!
% May       2013 - Completely redesigned with a new linking strategy that
%                  hopefully handles adjacent junctions correctly. It runs
%                  about twice as fast too.

    % Junctions are awkward when they are adjacent to other junctions.  We
    % start by looking at all the neighbours of a junction.  
    % If there is an adjacent junction we first create a 2-element edgetrack
    % that links the two junctions together.  We then look to see if there are
    % any non-junction edge pixels that are adjacent to both junctions. We then
    % test to see which of the two junctions is closest to this common pixel and
    % initiate an edge track from the closest of the two junctions through this
    % pixel.  When we do this we set the 'avoidJunction' flag in the call to
    % trackedge so that the edge track does not immediately loop back and
    % terminate on the other adjacent junction.

    % track out on any remaining untracked neighbours of the junction

% TRACKEDGE
%
% Function to track all the edge points starting from an end point or junction.
% As it tracks it stores the coords of the edge points in an array and labels the
% pixels in the edge image with the -ve of their edge number. This continues
% until no more connected points are found, or a junction point is encountered.
%
% Usage:   edgepoints = trackedge(rstart, cstart, edgeNo, r2, c2, avoidJunction)
% 
% Arguments:   rstart, cstart   - Row and column No of starting point.
%              edgeNo           - The current edge number.
%              r2, c2           - Optional row and column coords of 2nd point.
%              avoidJunction    - Optional flag indicating that (r2,c2)
%                                 should not be immediately connected to a
